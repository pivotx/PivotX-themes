# Brickwall

A theme ported to PivotX by [Lars Helbo](http://www.salldata.dk/). (Oiginal design by metamorphozis.com.)

It uses the coda-slider to show a gallery with the four most recent entries from all categories on top
of the front page. If an entry has an entry in the extra imagefield, this image will also be shown here.
