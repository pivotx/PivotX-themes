# Plain-N-Simple

Plain-n-simple is inspired by the simple design of the Posterous weblogs.
A simple theme for your personal blog, with a minimum of clutter to give
your writings the space they need. For the more experienced users this is
a nice basic theme, to edit to your own liking by changing colors and
backgrounds.
