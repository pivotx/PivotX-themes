# Shadow

A theme ported to PivotX by [Lars Helbo](http://www.salldata.dk/).
(Original design by New York Lasic.) Basically a simple two column, but with
a different look. It uses the jquery.ennui.contentslider to show selected 
entries on top of the page, including the content of the extra
imagefield, if used.
