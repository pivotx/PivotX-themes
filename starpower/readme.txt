Required PivotX version: 2.0 beta 12j
Used Extensions: lifestream widget

A few guidelines:

================

- Link section

Create a new page called 'links' and type your links as an unordered list (use the 'unordered list' button in the WYSIWYG editor in PivotX)
The theme publishes the 'introduction' part of the links page.

================

- Lifestream widget

Enable and configure the lifestream settings (the Extensions tab in PivotX)

Go to Extensions > Lifestream Configuration > scroll down

Set 'Widget Style' to 'Minimally Styled'

Change the html in the 'Header format' field to: 

<h2 class="lifestream">What I'm doing:</strong></h2>

Change the html code in the 'Output format' to:

<p><a href="%link%">%title% </a>- %date%</p>

Leave the 'Footer format' blank

ps
If you use the lifestreamwidget, you see a little blue bird on your frontpage. I didn't make that but I forgot who did. If you know, please let me know so I can give proper credits!

================

- Archivepage
Just use frontpage_template.html as your archivepage

================
