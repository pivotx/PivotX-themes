Installation

This template uses jquery.ennui.contentslider.js to show selected entries on top of the pages.

The slider will currently show the 10 most recent entries from the category linkdump. But you can change 
this by editing line 6 in the file _sub_gallery.tpl in the template folder. The line looks like this:

[[ subweblog category='linkdump' amount='10' ]][[ literal ]]

Instead of linkdump you may write the name of another category. You may also change the number 10 to 
show another number of entries in the slider.

Only the top of each entry will be shown; but if the user clicks the title (s)he will be redirected to 
the complete entry.
