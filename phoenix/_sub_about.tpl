<p>The Phoenix PivotX theme was made by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/johnschop" title="Follow on Twitter">John Schop</a> for <a href="http://www.windmillwebwork.com" title="Windmill Web Work">Windmill Web Work</a> in his spare time. If you appreciate the effort, consider <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=JP78HM65ZEKXW">donating</a>. In addition to the theme, you also need to install the 'Nivoslider' extension (if you want to use the slider).</p>
<p>There are no restrictions as to what you can do with this theme, but it would be nice if you could leave the links somwhere on the page.</p>
