Installation.

This theme uses Gallerax 0.2: a flexible gallery plugin for jQuery
made by nodethirtythree design | http://nodethirtythree.com/

The gallery is available in three different versions. You will find them in the template-files:

_sub_gallery01.tpl
_sub_gallery02.tpl
_sub_gallery03.tpl

You can select a different version with the include directive in front.tpl line 10.

Each gallery has its own css-file:

gallery01.css
gallery02.css
gallery03.css

The appropriate css-file must be included in _sub_header.tpl line 25

If you want to use your own images, you must provide images as well as thumbnails and enter
your images in the _sub_gallery-file.

In these files you can also change the text shown together with each image.
