Installation.

This ZIP-archive contains three folders.

liquid - must be placed in the template-folder of your PivotX-installation.
liquid-images - must be placed in the images-folder of your PivotX-installation.
piecemaker - the original piecemaker files. These are only included for reference. You don't need to put them on your webserver.

During installation you must edit the file piecemaker.xml. Here you must enter the name and location of your images and the accompanying text and links.

For reference on how to do this, see the file in piecemaker/documentation.

PLEASE NOTE: In the file piecemaker.xml the images and videos used must be listed with path and filename. 
Images may be listed with an absolute url (e.g. http://www.example.com/images/liquid-images/img_01.jpg) OR with a path relative to your site root (e.g. /images/liquid-images/img_01.jpg).

For a video the path must be given relative to the template folder. You can not use an absolute URL for a video.
