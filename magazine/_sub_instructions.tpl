The navigation works with the '<a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/j_birch/plugins/superfish/">Superfish</a>' script, and can be modified in the <em>_sub_header.tpl</em> file in the template folder.</p><p>Because the script relies on jQuery, it is a good idea to add the key 'always_jquery' with the value '1' in 'Advanced Configuration'. Pages are organized in submenu's under their chapter, and will be added automatically. The same goes for Categories and Archives.
