Installation

This template uses the extension Nivoslider by John Schop, so please download this from pivotx.net and
and activate it in your installation.

The archive contains two folders

template_001 contains the theme. This folder must be placed in your template folder.
template_001_slides contains the images for the slideshow. This folder must be placed in your Images folder.

If you want to place your slides at another location, you must edit the file _sub_nivoslider.tpl accordingly.

The template uses cufon-yui.js by Simo Kinnunen to convert the fonts used in the headlines.
