Installation

This template uses jQuery Roundabout by Fred LeBlanc to create a 3D rotating image gallery on the front page.

The archive contains two folders

woodtexture contains the theme. This folder must be placed in your template folder.
woodtexture-slides contains the images for the slideshow. This folder must be placed in your Images folder.

If you want to the images or place them in another location, you must edit the file _sub_gallery.tpl accordingly.

The template uses cufon-yui.js by Simo Kinnunen to convert the fonts used in the headlines.
