Installation of theme Bold
On top of the frontpage two featured entries are shown. These entries are selected with a 
special bonus field. Therefore you must first go to the PivotX website and download the 
extension Bonus Fields. Install and activate the extension. Then go to the admin interface:

extensions -> configure extensions -> bonus fields.

On the new page you must click the button ”Add bonusfield” and then you must fill it in like
this:

Name: slider
Internal name: slider
Type: checkbox
Location: entry - before introduction
Show if condition type: show if category (entry) or chapter (page)
Extra type information: 1

Save the changes.

When you now enter or edit an entry in the admin interface, you will see a new checkbox
just below the field for the subtitle. If you mark this checkbox, the entry will also be shown
in the slider. Only the first two marked entries will be shown like this.

Only the top of each entry will be shown; but if the user clicks the title (s)he will be
redirected to the complete entry.

-------

This theme also makes use of the extra image field. If an entry has an image in this field, it 
will be shown together with the entry.
